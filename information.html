	<h1>See Sri Lanka by train</h1>
    <p>Sri Lanka is a fabulous place, safe, friendly and remarkably hassle-free.  Sri Lanka's railways are 
        a great way to get around and a real cultural experience.  The most scenic routes will be highlights of your visit, in 
        particular the wonderful journey from Colombo to Kandy and up into Tea Country and the coastal train from Colombo to Dutch 
        colonial Galle.  British visitors will find the stations, signal boxes and old red semaphore signals very familiar!  This page is 
        a beginner's guide to train travel in Sri Lanka.</p>

            <h2>Colombo Fort station</h2>
                <p>Opened in 1917, Colombo Fort is Colombo's main station, right in the heart of the historic Fort area, walking distance from all
                     the sights.  All mainline & commuter trains go from here.  Colombo has a second main station one stop (2 km) to the east
                      called Maradana, most but not all trains stop here, but Colombo Fort is the best-located station to use.  See a map of 
                      Colombo showing stations.</p>
